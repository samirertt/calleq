💡 What is CallEQ?

CallEQ is an AI-powered, browser-based customer support assistant designed to simulate real-time web voice calls. Customers speak directly into the web app using their microphone. CallEQ transcribes the voice input, understands the question, detects emotional tone, and responds using realistic AI-generated speech — powered by LLMs and speech APIs.

📌 CallEQ is entirely internet-based (no phone number integration required), making it easy for businesses to embed on their website or internal systems.


🧠 Key Features

🎙️ Web-Based Voice Interaction
 Customers engage in real-time conversation using a browser — no need for a phone line.

🧾 Smart Knowledge Access (RAG)
 CallEQ uses a vector database and retrieval-augmented generation to answer customer-specific questions from company knowledge bases like FAQs, policies, and manuals.

😠 Emotion Detection
 CallEQ detects emotional signals in voice tone and/or language (e.g., anger, stress, calm) and dynamically adjusts the assistant's tone and response style accordingly.

🗣️ Realistic AI Voice
 LLM-generated responses are spoken back to the customer using high-quality AI voices (e.g., ElevenLabs), simulating a human-like voice agent.

🧪 Hackathon-Ready Simulation
 A web app demo allows judges or users to speak directly to CallEQ and experience dynamic responses with emotional tone shifting.



🌐 Use Cases

CallEQ can replace or supplement traditional live chat and call center agents, especially for:

Answering repetitive questions (orders, policies, account setup)

Detecting and responding to customer frustration or urgency
