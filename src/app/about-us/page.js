        </h1>

          CallEQ is an AI-powered, browser-based customer support assistant
          designed to simulate real-time web voice calls. Customers speak
          directly into the web app using their microphone. CallEQ transcribes
          the voice input, understands the question, detects emotional tone, and
          responds using realistic AI-generated speech â€” powered by LLMs and
          speech APIs.
